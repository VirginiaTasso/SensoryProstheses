## Continuous Interleaved Sampling Project

This is a simplified implementation of the Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) technique, commonly used in cochlear implants. Two audio signals, one speech and one music, have been processed using this technique as a proof of concept to demonstrate how CIS can decompose and reconstruct sound signals.
